Yet Another Hacker News Android Client

## Description

You can use this app keep you up to date with the latest news from Hacker News:

  - Top Stories
  - New Stories
  - Best Stories
  - Show HN
  - Ask HN
  - Jobs

## Data source

The application is using the new [HackerNews API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) for fetching all the stories.
Unfortunately, the API is not ready yet fetching comments properly so the solution for now is to scrape the website.

## Tests

Yahnac has tests around the parsing of Stories and Comments. You can execute them by using the new Unit Testing functionality addedd to Android Studio.
You can learn more about [testing](http://developer.android.com/tools/testing/testing_android.html) and [how to run them](http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/unit-testing-support)
